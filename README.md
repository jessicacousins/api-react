# React-API-Project

## Description

This repository is a **React** application that utilizes the **Harry Potter API** to display information about characters from the Harry Potter series. The main component, App, includes a search form where users can enter a character's name and retrieve relevant results. The search is triggered by submitting the form, and the API call is made using the useDataApi custom hook. The fetched data is then displayed as a set of cards, each representing a character. The cards contain the character's name, house, wand information, and patronus. The application also includes pagination functionality to navigate through the list of characters.
